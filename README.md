# Real-Time-Speech-to-Text-Conversion-using-OpenAI-Whisper-API
An API based Speech recognition using OpenAI Whisper Application.

The system provides users with an API that allows them to perform real-time speech-to-text conversion by recording audio directly through the interface. Users can initiate the recording process by clicking the "Start Recording" button and stop it by selecting the "Stop Recording" button. Once the recording is complete, the API returns a JSON response containing the transcribed text from the audio input. This functionality leverages OpenAI's Whisper API for accurate and efficient speech recognition and transcription. 


A user interface (UI) demonstrating the above functionality is shown below:
